Docker Machine:

Feature :
#	Install and run Docker on Mac or Windows
#	Provision and manage multiple remote Docker hosts
#	Provision Swarm clusters


Docker Machine is a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on virtual hosts, and manage the hosts with docker-machine commands. You can use Machine to create Docker hosts on your local Mac or Windows box, on your company network, in your data center, or on cloud providers like Azure, AWS, or Digital Ocean

Using docker-machine commands, you can start, inspect, stop, and restart a managed host, upgrade the Docker client and daemon, and configure a Docker client to talk to your host.

Docker for Windows is now available and should be used. 
Docker toolbox is for old machine where docker for windows cant be configured.
